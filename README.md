# DevOps Portfolio

Welcome to my **DevOps Portfolio**, where I demonstrate my practical experience with modern DevOps tools, processes, and best practices. This repository showcases various aspects of my skills, including **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **containerization**, in a real-world context.

## Key Contributions

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- Integrated **CircleCI** with a **Go** application for automated testing, building, and deployment. This pipeline includes:
  - Parallel test execution
  - Dependency caching for faster builds
  - **Security vulnerability scanning** using **Snyk**

### Blog Summaries
- Authored and summarized technical blogs on **DevOps** topics such as:
  - **Infrastructure as Code for DevOps Scaling**: Benefits of automating infrastructure management with **IaC** tools.
  - **Setting Up MLflow and Kubeflow**: A practical guide to managing **machine learning workflows**.

### Personal CV Landing Page
- Developed a professional, user-friendly **CV landing page** showcasing my experience and skills.
